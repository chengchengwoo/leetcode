# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]'
#
# Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
# around its center).
# 
# 
# For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
# 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# ⁠/ \ / \
# 3  4 4  3
# 
# 
# 
# But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]  is not:
# 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# ⁠  \   \
# ⁠  3    3
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
